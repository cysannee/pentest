# Default Gulp Project

## Installation
1. Clone repo
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `gulp` to initiate local server and watch for changes
4. Files and server root are in the `tmp` directory

*You can run `gulp build` to create files without server*

## Production
1. Run `gulp build --production` to disable sourcemaps and add minification

## Cleanup
1. Run `gulp clean` to empty `tmp` and `dist` folders

## Issues
Depending on your local permissions, you may have to remove all dependencies for `gulp-imagemin`, `imagemin-jpeg-recompress` and `imagemin-pngquant` from the `package.json` and `gulpfile.js` files before running `npm install` or `gulp`
